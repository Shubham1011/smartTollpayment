**Pay Toll smartly**

The growth in the population of cars has increased a lot and is predicted to burst through in the coming years. All of this introduces more traffic, more pollution and more cost to people. We cannot control the growth in the population of cars but can do a thing or two by tweaking some functionalities in some of the systems used by these cars. One such system is a Toll system and we could change the traditional way of a Toll system working into a modern way by utilizing the technology available to us. Here we introduce a new way of functioning of Toll System making use of Geofencing and real-time database, which greatly reduces the efforts taken at the toll and helps both the human and nature
